# Classifying Musical Decades 1922-2011 - Data Mining Project
Authors: Manthan Gadhia and Clara Maine

We test and contrast two techniques, a decision tree and and logistic regression, on the problem of decade classification based on average timbre. A cleaned and curated version of the Million Song Dataset was used.

A more detailed report of the experiment can be found in the Data_Mining_Project_Report.pdf and the code with preprocessing can be found in Data Mining Project.ipynb
